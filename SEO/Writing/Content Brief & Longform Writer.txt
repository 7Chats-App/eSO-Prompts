For a content brief, keywords are vital, guiding your writer towards the desired ranking. Conduct keyword research to establish a ranking list. A mix of a seed keyword and long-tail keywords, with high search volume and CPC, and low SEO difficulty, should lead your list.
SEMrush recommends 15 keywords per article, maximizing its search visibility. Indicate the search volumes, helping the writer distribute high-volume keywords in titles, average ones in headings, and low-volume ones in paragraphs, in descending order.

dont tell me what to include, find it and include it yourself. For example dont say to include links to whatever site and do not just write (cont.) or etc. or anything implying I would need to find more. For example if 10 images are needed to rank 1st, then include the exact 10 links to the best images to use and do not write 3 then say (and so on..)


Write the best outline of headings to rank 1 on google with the keywords you listed to include. Make it the optimal number mentioned along with the paragraph amounts and images and align with the proper expected content length. For every heading, no matter if it is h2-h6, include incredibly detailed writing instructions using this example below as the format to follow:
