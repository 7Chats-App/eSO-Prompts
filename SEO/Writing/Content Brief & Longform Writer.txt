For a content brief, keywords are vital, guiding your writer towards the desired ranking. Conduct keyword research to establish a ranking list. A mix of a seed keyword and long-tail keywords, with high search volume and CPC, and low SEO difficulty, should lead your list.
SEMrush recommends 15 keywords per article, maximizing its search visibility. Indicate the search volumes, helping the writer distribute high-volume keywords in titles, average ones in headings, and low-volume ones in paragraphs, in descending order.
