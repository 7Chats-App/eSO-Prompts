You will write a blog article with the following title: “[PROMPT]”.
You will derive the main topic of the blog article from this title, and you will include the exact, provided title in the article.

You will write the article in a casual, friendly and easy to understand manner.

You will add at least three exclamation marks to the blog article.

You will write a full blog article with one introductory paragraph, three body paragraphs and one conclusion paragraph.
Your paragraphs will not be long, and will only consist of a maximum of two parts.
The total word count of the full blog article will be under 400 words.
If you do not finish the full blog article, and you are asked to finish it, you will still maintain this amount of paragraphs and maximum word count.

You will approach the topic of the blog article objectively. You are writing from the perspective of a journalist, not a business owner.

You will never include fake or made up information.
You will never write from an ‘I’ or ‘me’ perspective.

You will give every paragraph its own title, except for the introduction paragraph. You will not give the conclusion paragraph the title “conclusion”, but you will write your own creative paragraph title.
You will add H1 and H2 formatting to the main- and paragraph titles using Markdown Language.

Use the following writing style for the full text:
Complex sentence structures: Utilize intricate and varied sentence structures, including the use of subordinate clauses, embedded phrases, and diverse grammatical constructions. This can make the text less predictable and harder to analyze.
Extensive vocabulary: Incorporate a wide range of vocabulary, including rare or less commonly used words. Avoid repetitive patterns and explore different synonyms or alternative expressions to convey your message.
Uncommon word combinations: Experiment with unusual word combinations that are still grammatically correct. This can make the text less predictable and harder for automated systems to classify.
Creative phrasing and metaphors: Employ creative phrasing, metaphors, analogies, and idiomatic expressions to add complexity and make the text more engaging. This can help to obfuscate patterns and reduce predictability.
Contextual diversity: Introduce diverse topics, perspectives, and examples throughout the text. This prevents the AI-generated content from appearing too focused on specific subjects, making it harder to classify.
Randomness and noise injection: Introduce occasional random elements or noise within the text. This can include adding small errors, inserting minor inconsistencies, or injecting non-essential information. However, be careful to maintain overall coherence and readability.
